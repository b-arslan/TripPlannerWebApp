## About The Project

TripPlanner is a web application designed to provide users with personalized travel itineraries. Developed using Next.js and TypeScript, the application collects travel start and end dates as well as the city to be visited from the user. Based on this information, it creates a detailed travel plan using various third-party APIs.

- **Travel Date and City Input:** Users provide their travel start and end dates along with the cities they plan to visit. This foundational information drives all further itinerary suggestions.

- **Event Recommendations:** The app leverages third-party APIs to furnish users with a curated list of events occurring in the chosen cities during their travel dates. This includes cultural festivals, concerts, exhibitions, and more, ensuring that travelers can partake in local activities.

- **Dining and Entertainment Venues:** Based on user preferences and location data, TripPlanner suggests top dining spots and entertainment venues. Whether you're looking for a quiet café, a vibrant bar, or a family-friendly restaurant, the app guides you to the best places to eat and relax.
